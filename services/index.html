					<h2 class="inner">Press Capabilties</h2>
					<p>
						Our core capability is offset printing on presses specifically designed to print 
						on envelopes. NEI’s Jet Offset Presses can print from one color to four color 
						process with detailed image reproduction and controlled color accuracy, providing 
						our customers a quality product quickly and efficiently. Whether we’re printing a thousand 
						envelopes or a million envelopes, you can depend on us to pay careful attention 
						to every detail – from copy and position, to color matching, color breaks and run 
						consistency.
					</p>
					<p>
						Jet Offset Printing is a lithography process that offers the highest quality for 
						envelope printing. It produces a clear, well-defined image area and provides 
						excellent ink coverage. Here is a list of NEI’s Jet Offset equipment and 
						capabilities.
					</p>
					<h3>Halm Jet Press</h3>

						Jet Presses are the fastest around. These presses are capable of a printing area 
						of up to 9" x 12". Printing full bleed on the front and back of the envelope is 
						possible – up to 4 1/8" x 9 1/2". With the ability to perfect, the Jet Press enables 
						you to print both sides of the envelope in one pass.

						our customers can be sure their shipment will arrive on time – handled with care. Our 
						13,000-square-foot, climate controlled warehouse gives you the option and

					<a class="black" name="converting"></a>
					<h2 class="inner">Envelope Converting</h2>
					<p>
						Litho/Offset Envelope Converting is the process in which a flat sheet of printed 
						paper is converted into an envelope. There are several benefits to converting 
						envelopes.
					</p>
					<li>
						The creativity of the design is not limited because of the printing capabilities 
						on pre-manufactured envelopes
					</li>
					<li>
						Bleeds, large solids, or full custom tints can be printed on coated or uncoated 
						stock to enhance the design
					</li>
					<li>
						Foil Stamping and register embossing can be done
					</li>
					<br>
					<p>
						Our Envelope Converting partners provide us with competitive pricing and 
						manufacturing time frames. We have access to both "High" and "Adjustable" 
						die cutting configurations. Consult with your NEI representative to see if 
						envelope converting can benefit your design.

					<a class="black" name="flexo"></a>
					<h2 class="inner">Flexography</h2>
					<p>
						Flexography is a printing process in which the printing plate places ink directly 
						onto the paper. Ink is applied to the raised surface of the plate. The inked image 
						is then pressed directly onto the paper. The Flexography process (“Flexo”) is 
						commonly used by envelope manufacturers. Through our strategic partnerships, 
						NEI can utilize Flexography printing as a possible solution for your envelope 
						needs. Talk with your NEI representative to find out if your envelope requirements 
						can work with Flexography.
