					<h3>USPS Postal Increase</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						The United States Postal Service (USPS) announced proposed price changes, including an increase in the
						price of a First-Class Mail single-piece letter from 46 cents to 49 cents. The proposed changes, which
						would go into effect in January 2014, are intended to generate $2 billion in incremental annual revenue
						for the Postal Service. Standard flats are slated to increase 6.1 percent and catalog/magazine mailers
						could see a 5.9 percent postal rate increase, on average. The 5.9 percent includes a 4.3 percent exigent
						price increase on top of the 1.6 percent increase that is capped by the rate of inflation.
						<br>
						<br>
						Highlights of the new single-piece First-Class Mail pricing, effective Jan. 26, 2014, include:
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Letters (1 oz.)—3-cent increase to 49 cents</li>
							<li>Letters additional ounces—1-cent increase to 21 cents</li>
							<li>Letters to all international destinations (1 oz.)—$1.15</li>
							<li>Postcards—1-cent increase to 34 cents</li>
